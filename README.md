## Getting started

- Install [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org)
- Clone this repository
- `cd hash`
- `npm install` to install the application's dependencies
- `npm start` to start the application

## Additional features added

Here are some ideas on how it can be improved using other Electron APIs.

- Refactoring for readability.
- Make headings links that open to Wikipedia page for algorithm.
- Display time taken to compute each hash.
